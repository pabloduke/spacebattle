NOTE:

THIS PROJECT USES JAVA NAMING CONVENTIONS

I TRIED USING IMyInterface in the C# way and found it completely disgusting. There is something wrong with you .NET people.

Anyways in the unlikely case anyone other than me needs to maintain this codebase....DEAL WITH IT

Interface: Ship Implmentation: ShipImpl

ALL TOGETHER NOW: ShipImpl : Ship { //do stuff }

Oh, squirrelly braces are using every other languages curly brace convention. Who do you .NET people think you are??? Python Devs???? Maybe you should start using whitespace to determine code blocks... smh Curly Braces on next line is fucking stupid.

Hopefully I got around to writing numerous tests that will fail if you try to change the squirrelly brace convention.
